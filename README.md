# OLAC_Redesign

**Group 12: Sem Hu, Thijs Spoelstra & Liam Klunder**

[_Our Redesign of OLAC_](https://liamklunder.github.io)

We have redesigned OLAC using a [_prototype_](https://www.figma.com/proto/U65HFrP9SQTOIMfeJXjwSr/Assignment-3?node-id=0-1&t=8njBXRi2hrOn5LYQ-1)
 made in Figma. 

 We have improved on the original OLAC website, increasing its clarity and visuals:

 >The prototype design is a good improvement over the original OLAC website in terms of modern design and organising information. The trending page is a nice addition to the website. - [Web technology OLAC page redesign peer review](https://brightspace.rug.nl/d2l/common/viewFile.d2lfile/Database/MTI0MzM0MDI/peer%20review%20olac%20for%20group%2012.pdf?ou=414560&display=1)
