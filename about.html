				metadata.xml - example document
			</p>
			<h1>Founding Documents</h1>
			<p>
				These documents were presented at the international workshop in December 2000 where OLAC was established. One hundred participants, representing language resource projects in North and South America, Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia, reviewed these documents and reached general consensus supporting the foundation of OLAC.<br />

			<h1>Timeframe</h1>
			<p>
				From mid Dec 2000: Alpha testers mapped catalog data to Dublin Core using the XML format required by the OAI, and registered with the OAI as a data provider.<br />
				From March 2001: Alpha testers mapped catalog data to the beta version of the OLAC metadata set, and participated in discussions of the metadata, leading to a release version. All alpha testers modified their data providers to support this version.<br />
				January 2002: OLAC was launched to the wider community, and the OLAC standards were frozen at version 0.3 for 12 months to encourage widespread implementation (the pilot phase)<br />
				Early 2003: The OLAC standards were refined once more, based on experience during the pilot phase. The OLAC operational phase began when the standards were released at version 1.0.
